# qExplorer

To run this process you first need to have a locally running Bitcoin full node.
To install a full node follow the instructions given [here](https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node)

## Download source code using GIT

```C++
git clone git@github.com:jlucid/qExplorer.git
```

## Set Configuration settings

Navigate to the config/settings.q file and set the mainDB and refDB file paths.
These paths will set the location where block data will be stored.
In addition, set the rpc username and password values to match those
in the bitcoin.conf file used by your locally running node

```C++
// Location of mainDB and refDB
// Locations need to be different

mainDB:`:.;
refDB:`:.; 

// Credentials for JSON RPC

rpcUsername:"";
rpcPassword:"";
```

## qUtil

The qExplorer assumes that your system already has the [qutil](https://github.com/nugend/qutil) library installed.

Once installed, create a soft link named "qExplorer" in your QPATH directory which points to the qExplorer folder. This will enable standard .utl.require function to locate the init.q file and load all required tables and source files. 

```C++
    q).utl.require "qExplorer"
```

# Run the process

The process can be strted from the command line by running the following command

```C++
    $)q qExplorer/app/qExplorer.q
```
